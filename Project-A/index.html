    <h2> Metamorphosis Magic</h2>
    <p>Metamorphosis Magic simulates the metamorphosis process of a psychedelic butterfly from egg to caterpillar to cocoon to butterfly. Metamorphosis is a biological process by which an animal physically develops including birth transformation or hatching and evolves into their full fledged form. The psychedelic butterfly is beautiful, yet dangerous. They lure their prey in by putting them in a trace with their unique colors. This artwork recreates the evolution process allowing the user to interact with each stage along the way.
