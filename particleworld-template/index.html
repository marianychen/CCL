  <p>The inspiration for this code was from the teamLab Borderless light show. During the field trip, I was in awe of the crystal wall exhibition with all of its colorful lights portraying beautiful and alluring colors.<br> I felt entranced by the show and could have stood there for hours. I wanted to recreate that effect with my code by using different speeds, directions, and colors. To recreate the crystals, I created a diamond shaped star. <br> Because the background of the lightshow also changed colors, I created an interactive mouse portion. The user is able to change the background color depending on where the mouse is. </p>
